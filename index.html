      <h3>How We Met</h3>
      <img class="metPics" src="../img/how-we-met.jpg" alt="First Picture Together" />
      <p>Nicholas and I met through mutual friends when I was a junior in high school. We began dating 4 days after my 17th birthday (October 15, 2011) and we have fallen in love with each other more and more over the years.</p>
      <br />

      <h3>The Proposal</h3>
      <img class="metPics" src="../img/proposal.jpg" alt="Proposal Picture" />
      <p>
        For our 5 year anniversary, we decided to plan a vacation to the happiest place on earth! DISNEY WORLD!! We traveled down to Orlando, FL. and started the week off with excitement for the magic that Disney brings. On November 27th, I wanted to go to the Animal Kingdom for our first day. Animals are my life. My job, my passion, my world revolves around animals and always has. Nicholas has definitely taken this in over the years. The first thing I wanted to do was to get a picture in front of the tree of life, but Nicholas insisted that I wait until later on in the day. So I wanted to instantly go on the Kali River Rapids Raft Ride! You get soaking wet and get an instant cool down from the heat. Nicholas insisted that we wait and we can do the Rapids after we get a picture taken in front of the tree. So I asked if we can do the Safari (Live animals!!! A MUST for me) and Nicholas once again insisted that we once again do it later. We went on with the day (a little annoyed that all my favorite things to do have been vetoed until later that day). We went on rides, ate awesome food, saw animals, and watched the Lion King show. Nicholas seemed anxious throughout the day, but I didn't think much of it. After we saw the Lion King show, Nicholas FINALLY asked if I wanted to go to the tree of life! We darted over to the tree and waited in line for our pictures. Nicholas was looking around and becoming fidgety. I asked if everything was okay, and he assured me he was fine. Front of the line. I started to walk up to where the photographer told us to stand. I look back and Nicholas is quickly saying something to the photographer. When he reached me I asked him what he said. He told me he asked her to do a specific pose that he thought I would like. So the photographer starts taking our picture. Telling us all different was to pose. After about the 4th pose she asked me to put my hands on Nicholas' chest. When I did I felt his heartbeat. As a Veterinary Nurse, I am of course taking his heart rate and it was THROUGH THE ROOF! I turned to him and asked him if he was okay and told him his heart was racing. He then got on one knee. This moment was a blur for me. I had been waiting for 5 years for this moment (Actually my whole life). I instantly became the cry baby that I am and started making an ugly crying face. He pulled out the ring. He started saying the words "We are in front of the tree of ....." and that is all he got out before I RIPPED that ring out of his hands and made him kiss me! Everyone around us was clapping and cheering. After our little photoshoot post engagement, I instantly Facetimed my Best Friend, AKA my sister! When I Facetimed her she was over at our grandparent’s house with my whole family (They were celebrating a late thanksgiving dinner together) and everyone already knew this was happening! Immediately after he told me he had ONE MORE SURPRISE for me. He told me that he knew how much animals mean me, so he set up a private Safari tour for us. On the tour, we went through the "Savanna" and had a private tour guide. At the end of the tour, we were in the middle of the "Savanna", I looked over and there was a beautiful gazebo with our very own bartenders and waitresses. We had a three-course meal and every glass of wine or beer that we drank put money towards animal conservation. Behind the gazebo was a deck where we got to use binoculars to look at the lion den (which is usually inactive during normal tours). When we got back to the park after our amazing tour and dinner, our tour guide told us each to pick a specific conservation we would like to have HALF of what Nicholas paid for the tour to go to. This experience meant so much to me! He knew what was important to me and made sure to incorporate all of it into the proposal.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Most importantly, he made sure that I DID NOT get my hair wet by going on the Rapids early on in the day!!</p>
      <br />
      <p>Afterward, we got onto our bus to go back to our hotel. Nicholas reminded me that he never got to say the small speech he had wanted to say to me, in addition, to never officially asking me to marry him. So on the bus to the hotel is where Nicholas turned to me and said "We were in front of the tree of life and this is where I wanted to start my life with you. Will you marry me?" And at 11:47 pm on a crowded bus, I officially said "yes" to the love of my life.</p>
      <br />

      <h3>Since the Proposal</h3>
      <img class="metPics" src="../img/sinceproposal.jpg" alt="Our first home" />
      <p>Since we got engaged in 2016, Nicholas and I decided to plan out our lives. We both found amazing jobs and worked towards buying our first home in August 2018. Now we are finally ready to begin this journey called our wedding...</p>
