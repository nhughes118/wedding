      <h3>How We Met</h3>
      <img class="metPics" src="../img/how-we-met.jpg" alt="First Picture Together" />
      <p>Savannah & Nicholas met through mutual friends when Savannah was a junior in high school. We began dating 4 days after Savannah's 17th birthday (October 15, 2011) and have fallen in love with each other more and more over the years.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>The Proposal</h3>
      <img class="metPics" src="../img/proposal.jpg" alt="Proposal Picture" />
      <p>For our 5 year anniversary we decided to plan a vacation to the happiest place on earth! DISNEY WORLD!! We travelled down to Orlando, FL. and started the week off with excitement for the magic that Disney brings. On November 27th, Savannah wanted to go to Animal Kingdom for our first day. Animals are Savannah's life. Her job, her passion, and her world revolves around animals and always has. Nicholas has definitely taken this in over the years. The first thing Savannah wanted to do was to get a picture in front of the tree of life, but Nicholas insisted that she wait until later on in the day. So Savannah wanted to instantly go on the Kali River Rapids Raft Ride! You get soaking wet and get an instant cool down from the heat. Nicholas insisted that we wait and we can do the Rapids after we get a pictures taken in front of the tree. So Savannah asked if we could do the Safari (Live animals!!! A MUST for her) and Nicholas once again insisted that we once again, do it later. We went on with the day (a little annoyed that all of her favorite things to do have been veto'd until later that day). We went on rides, ate awesome food, saw animals and watched the Lion King show. Nicholas seemed anxious through out the day, but Savannah didn't think much of it. After we saw the Lion King show, Nicholas FINALLY asked if Savannah wanted to go to the tree of life! We darted over to the tree and waited in line for our pictures. Nicholas was looking around and becoming fidgety. Savannah asked if everything was okay, and he assured her he was fine. Front of the line. Savannah starts to walk up to where the photographer told us to stand. She looked back and Nicholas was quickly saying something to the photographer. When he reached Savannah she asked him what he said. He told her he asked her to do a specific pose that he thought she would like. So the photographer starts taking our picture. Telling us all different ways to pose. After about the 4th pose she asked Savannah to put her hands on Nicholas' chest. When she did she felt his heartbeat. As a Veterinary Nurse, Savannah is of course taking his heart rate and it was THROUGH THE ROOF! She turned to him and asked him if he was okay and told him his heart was racing. He then got on one knee. This moment was a blurr for Savannah. She had been waiting 5 years for this moment (Actually my whole life). She instantly became the cry baby that she is and started making an ugly crying face. He pulled out the ring. He started saying the words "We are in front of the tree of ....." and that is all he got out before Savannah RIPPED that ring out of his hands and made Nicholas kiss her! Everyone around us was clapping and cheering. After our little photo shoot post engagement, Savannah instantly Facetimed her Best Friend, AKA her sister! When Savannah Facedtimed her she was over our grandparents house with Savannah's whole family (They were celebrating a late Thanksgiving dinner together) and everyone already knew this was happening! Immediately after, Nicholas told Savannah he had ONE MORE SURPRISE for her. He told her that he knew how much animals mean her, so he set up a private Safari tour for us. On the tour we went through the "Savanna" and had a private tour guide. At the end of the tour, we were in the middle of the "Savanna", Savannah looked over and there was a beautiful gazebo with our very own bartenders and waitresses. We had a three course meal, and every glass of wine or beer that we drank put money towards animal conservation. Behind the gazebo was a deck where we got to use binoculars to look at the lion den (which is usually inactive during normal tours). When we got back to the park after our amazing tour and dinner, our tour guide told us each to pick a conservation we would like to have HALF of what Nicholas paid for the tour to go to. This experience meant so much to Savannah! Nicholas knew what was important to her and made sure to incorporate all of it into the proposal.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Most importantly, he made sure that Savannah DID NOT get her hair wet by going on the Rapids early on in the day!!</p>
      <br />
      <p>Afterwards, we got onto our bus to go back to our hotel. Nicholas reminded Savannah that he never got to say the small speech he had wanted to say to her in addition to never officially asking Savannah to marry him. So on the bus to the hotel is where Nicholas turned to Savannah and said "We were in front of the tree of life and this is where I wanted to start my life with you. Will you marry me?" And at 11:47pm on a crowded bus, Savannah officially said "yes" to the love of her life.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Since the Proposal</h3>
      <img class="metPics" src="../img/sinceproposal.jpg" alt="Our first home" />
      <p>Since we got engaged in 2016, Savannah & Nicholas decided to plan out our lives. We both found amazing jobs and worked towards buying our first home in August 2018. Now we are finally ready to begin this journey called our wedding....</p>
